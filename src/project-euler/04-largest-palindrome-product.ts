 * Question:
 * A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
 * Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
 *
 * My Notes:
 * There are two approaches to do this, we could itterate through all combinations or we could itterate through
 * all palindromes within our result space.  We are going to do the later
